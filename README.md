# Into The Stars :star2:

**Into The Stars** is a short, narrative-driven platformer game developed using Unity. The game combines diverse mechanics, challenging traps, and innovative movement features, all wrapped in a cohesive story that can be completed in 5-10 minutes. Inspired by games like *Downwell*, *Geometry Dash*, and *N++*, we aimed to deliver a polished experience that balances gameplay and storytelling.
